Firstly, sorry about the lack of posts, I didn't have time to post over GCSE season, and the rest of the time I had nothing to post about, however, expect to see way more posts now, as I will continue to work on this project.



Anyways, onto the main topic - the Fenwickshire project! Now you may be wondering, "What on earth is Fenwickshire??", well, Fenwickshire is my new MTR project that I'll be working on for the forseeable future. It is a fictional county based on Worcestershire and the West Midlands. The county town is Fenwick, a cathedral city located near the centre of the county. I will initially focus on building out rail stations/lines, and will faill in buildings and roads later. The West-Coast Main Line runs through the county, with stops at Drunwich, Doddon Common, Irongrid, Fenwick and Alderbee. The (very incomplete) map below shows the currently drawn out lines, towns and cities.

The world is set in the 2020s, and will include many small details to maximise realism. The Minecraft map was generated using the amazing [EarthToMc](earthtomc.com) software, and is mostly Worcestershire, with some parts of the surrounding counties on the edges. The TOCs who operate services will be: Avanti West Coast - WCML high-speed services, London Northwestern Railways - WCML low-speed services, West Midlands Railways - regional/commuter services for Fenwick and GWR - regional. Eventually, most towns will be connected using busses/roads as well, but this is planned for the far future.



That's all for now, but I'll keep posting updates here, so make sure you subscribe to the newsletter to stay up-to-date!
