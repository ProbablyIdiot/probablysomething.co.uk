There's a few things certain in life: death, taxes and Spotify's shuffle algorithm eternally sucking ass. We all know the problem, you go to listen to your miles long playlist, hoping to find some long-lost music to rediscover, just to be given the same 10 or so songs as always? Every time I try to shuffle my playlist, I mourn the death of Google Play Music and accept my fate. 

Well, I've finally snapped and I've decided to find a solution. Many sites tell you useless fixes, like to disable automix in Spotify's settings (it was already disabled), or simply tell users to jump ship to another platform. However, if you dig a little deeper, and search through the GitHub, you can find a solution!

Full credit to [kartikk221](https://github.com/kartikk221) and all the other contributors for this, I did nothing to contribute to this. Just head to [True Shuffle](https://spotify-true-shuffle.pages.dev/#), connect your Spotify account, and you're done! If you have the app installed locally, or connected to an Alexa device, you can just select your desired playlist and device, hit shuffle, and be amazed by someone who can create a simple randomiser!

Anyways, I hope this helped, make sure to leave a comment if you have any other Spotify problems/fixes I should check out.
