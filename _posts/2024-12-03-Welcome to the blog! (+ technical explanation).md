Hello, and welcome to the first post of my new website. This has been about a year in the making, and I'm really happy with how it's turned out. In the future, I'll be posting all my programming, 3d-printing and othe r miscellaneous techie projects here. More pages are also due to be added in the future, as well as rss and newsletter capabilities.

### How does the website work?

Well - it's complicated. I started this project, trying to build a custom, plain HTML + CSS website, with a few python scripts to manage the blogging system - it went about as well as you'd expect, but I learned some valuable web development skills that are used in this final versions of the website. So, finally, I settled on using Jekyll for the backend. For hosting, I used GitHub pages, but using actions, instead of the default configuration. This was to allow me to use the jekyll-paginate-v2 and jekyll-sitemap plugins. My domain registrar is NameCheap, as they had the cheapest rate for this url, and I used CloudFlare free tier for DNS, caching and CDN purposes. Finally, the the aestetics are made using the fantastic [98.css](https://jdan.github.io/98.css/) and Alex Meub's [Windows 98 Icon collection](https://win98icons.alexmeub.com/).



So, expect more posts like this in the future (although, they'll probably be longer next time) and more features to come.
