I made this theme after seeing a picture of an IBM PS/2 P70, with it's gorgeous yellow/orange gas-plasma display. This theme is based off that colour-scheme, although a bit more yellow-ey and some blue to differentiate things. I've published this on the marketplace (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ProbablyThemes.YellowPlasma ), go download it now! 

P.S. I would put a tutorial here, but this was a real pain in the arse, and I can't be bothered to work it out, just start at https://themes.vscode.one and you might figure it out.
